#Now start multiple instances of the apache service by setting the scale parameter of the Docker Compose command to the number of services we want to start.

#For example:

#docker-compose up --scale apache=2
#The above command will start two instances of Apache application, which can be accessed at http://localhost:4000. The requests to this URL will get load balanced and distributed to one of the two apache docker containers.
